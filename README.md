# GEC
This is a repo about the GEC programms I have created as part of the GEC module at Staffordshire University. I created the programms to practice and  because it allows me me to demonstrate and show proof of the things i have achieved such as the skills. I did this through Github as it allows easy edits of HTML and can easily access my own porfolio through here. Making any changes with Github can be solved in a cinch!
